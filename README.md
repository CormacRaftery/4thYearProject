# Introduction<a name = "introduction"></a>
For my final year project I have decided to create a dynamic web-application that allows employees to easily view their schedule and allows employers to upload the schedule. I have been inspired to do this project due to working with a frustrating schedule website over the summer. The aim for this project is to have everything an employee or employer could need in one place. It is a three-tier application, using MongoDB as the Data Tier, Java for the Logic Tier, and Angular 8 for the Presentation Tier. This is a slight change to the currently popular set of technologies otherwise known as the MEAN stack.
